ntroduction
This programming project is mainly for constructing an R function is able to cache potentially time-consuming computations. Why should I do this? Consider, for example, taking the mean of a numeric vector is typically a fast operation. However, for a very long vector, it may take too long to compute the mean, especially if it has to be computed repeatedly (e.g. in a loop). If the contents of a vector are not changing, it may make sense to cache the value of the mean so that when we need it again, it can be looked up in the cache rather than recomputed. This little programming project will be the basic work for future big data analysis and computations.

Main work
The following two functions are used to calculate the inverse of a matrix, if the matrix has been cached before, the inverse of a matrix will be returned right now rather than compute it repeatedly

The following function makeCacheMatrix creates a special “matrix”, which is really a list containing a function to
set the value of the matrix
get the value of the matrix
set the inverse of the matrix
get the inverse of the matrix
makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
m <- NULL
set <- function(y)
{
x <<- y
m <<- NULL
}
get <- function() x
setinverse <- function(inverse) m <<- inverse
getinverse <- function() m
list(set = set, get = get, setinverse = setinverse, getinverse = getinverse)
}
The following function cacheSolve calculates the inverse of the special “matrix” created with the above function it first checks to see if the inverse of the matrix has already been calculated. If so, it gets the inverse from the cache and skips the computation. Otherwise, it calculates the inverse of the data and sets the inverse matrix in the cache via the setinverse function.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
m <- x$getinverse()
if(!is.null(m)) {
message("getting cached data")
return(m)
}
data <- x$get()
m <- solve(data, ...)
x$setinverse(m)
m
}
