## Our aim in this experiment is to write a pair of functions, namely, 
## "makeCacheMatrix" and "cacheSolve" that cache the inverse of a matrix

## makeCacheMatrix is a function which creates a special "matrix" object that can 
## cache its inverse for the input (which is an invertible square matrix)

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## cacheSolve is a function which computes the inverse of the special "matrix" 
## returned by makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been calculated 
## (and the matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve should retrieve the 
## inverse from the cache

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
