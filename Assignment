#Assignment: Caching the Inverse of a Matrix

#makeCacheMatrix: This function creates a special “matrix” object that can cache its inverse.
#cacheSolve: This function computes the inverse of the special “matrix” returned by makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then the cacheSolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.
makeCacheMatrix creates a list containing a function to
# set the value of the matrix
# get the value of the matrix
# set the value of inverse of the matrix
# get the value of inverse of the matrix
# Function “cacheSolve” computes the inverse of the special “matrix” (which is the input of cachemean) returned by makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache. If the inverse has not been calculated, data gets the matrix stored with makeCacheMatrix, m calculates the inverse, and x$setmean(m) stores it in the object m in makeCacheMatrix.


makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
      m <- NULL
      set <- function(y) {
            x <<- y
            m <<- NULL
      }
      get <- function() x
      setinverse <- function(solve) m <<- solve
      getinverse <- function() m
      list(set = set, get = get,setinverse = setinverse,getinverse = getinverse)
}

Function “cacheSolve” computes the inverse of the special “matrix” (which is the input of cachemean) returned by makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache. If the inverse has not been calculated, data gets the matrix stored with makeCacheMatrix, m calculates the inverse, and x$setmean(m) stores it in the object m in makeCacheMatrix.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
      m <- x$getinverse()
      if(!is.null(m)) {
            message("getting cached data")
            return(m)
      }
      data <- x$get()
      m <- solve(data, ...)
      x$setinverse(m)
      m
}
