## Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and their may be some benefit 
## to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than compute it repeatedly 
## Below are two functions that cache the inverse of a matrix

## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
        m <- NULL
        set <- function(y) {
                x <<- y
                m <<- NULL
        }
        get <- function() x
        setinverse <- function(solve) m <<- solve
        getinverse <- function() m
        list(set = set, get = get,
             setinverse = setinverse,
             getinverse = getinverse)
}

## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by 
## makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been calculated 
## (and the matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve should retrieve 
## the inverse from the cache

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
        m <- x$getinverse()
        if(!is.null(m)) {
                message("getting cached data")
                return(m)
        }
        data <- x$get()
        m <- solve(data, ...)
        x$setinverse(m)
        m  
}

## example for testing functions ##

## mat<-makeCacheMatrix( matrix(c(1,2,2,3), nrow = 2, ncol = 2))
## cacheSolve(mat)
