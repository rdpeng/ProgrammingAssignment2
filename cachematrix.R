## The functions take a matrix as an argument and return its inverse. 
## If the inverse has already bean calculated, then it would retrieve the inverse from the cache.

##  This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
    m <- NULL
    set <- function(y) {
        x <<- y
        m <<- NULL
    }
    get <- function() x
    setinv <- function(inverse) m <<- inverse
    getinv <- function() m
    list(set = set, get = get,
         setinv = setinv,
         getinv = getinv)
}


## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above. 
## If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve would retrieve the inverse from the cache.
