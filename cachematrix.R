## Caching the Inverse of a Matrix:
## Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some 
## benefit to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than compute it repeatedly.
## Below are a pair of functions that are used to create a special object that 
## stores a matrix and caches its inverse.

## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
        inv <- NULL
        set <- function(y) {
                x <<- y
                inv <<- NULL
        }
        get <- function() x
        setInverse <- function(solveMatrix) inv <<- solveMatrix
        getInverse <- function() inv
        list(set = set, 
             get = get,
             setInverse = setInverse,
             getInverse = getInverse)
}
