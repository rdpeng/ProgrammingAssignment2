## Assignment: Caching the Inverse of a Matrix
## 1. makeCacheMatrix: This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.
## 2. cacheSolve: This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above. 
##                If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), 
##                then the cachesolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.


## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
aaa
}


## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
