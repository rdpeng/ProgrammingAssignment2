## These two functions compute the inverse of a square matrix, 
## caching the inverse already calculated 
## and retrieving them from the cache rather than compute them repeatedly. 

## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
      m <- NULL
      set <- function(y) {
            x <<- y
            m <<- NULL
      }
      get <- function() x
      setmean <- function(mean) m <<- mean
      getmean <- function() m
      list(set = set, get = get,
           setmean = setmean,
           getmean = getmean)
      
}


## Computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix.
## If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), 
## then the cachesolve retrieves the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
      m <- x$getmean()
      if(!is.null(m)) {
            message("getting cached data")
            return(m)
      }
      data <- x$get()
      m <- solve(data, ...)
      x$setmean(m)
      m
}
