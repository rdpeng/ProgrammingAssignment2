### Caching the Inverse of a Matrix:
## Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some 
## benefit to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than compute it repeatedly.
## Below are a pair of functions that are used to create a special object that 
## stores a matrix and caches its inverse.

## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
        
        inv = NULL
        set <- function(y) {
                x <<- y
                inv <<- NULL
        }
        get = function() x
        setinv = function(inverse) inv <<- inverse 
        getinv = function() inv
        list(set=set, get=get, setinv=setinv, getinv=getinv)
}

## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" created by 
## makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been calculated (and the 
## matrix has not changed), then it should retrieve the inverse from the cache.


cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        
        inv = x$getinv()
        if (!is.null(inv)){
                message("getting cached data")
                return(inv)
        }
        mat.data <- x$get()
        inv <- solve(mat.data, ...)
        
        # sets the value of the inverse in the cache via the setinv function.
        x$setinv(inv)
        
        return(inv)
}
