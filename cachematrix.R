## Caching the Inverse of a Matrix:
## Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some 
## benefit to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than compute it repeatedly.
## Below are a pair of functions that are used to create a special object that 
## stores a matrix and caches its inverse.

## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
<<<<<<< HEAD
  m<-NULL
  set<-function(y){
    x <<- y
    m <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setinverse <- function(solve) m <<- solve
  getinverse <- function() m
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setinverse = setinverse,
       getinverse = getinverse)

}


## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" created by 
## makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been calculated (and the 
## matrix has not changed), then it should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
  m <- x$getinverse()
  if(!is.null(m)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(m)
  }
  mat <- x$get()
  m <- solve(mat, ...)
  x$setinverse(m)
  m
}
